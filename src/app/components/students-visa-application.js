Student Visa is one of the four types of visas that will enable students to legally enter a foreign country to commence their study program.</p>

And obtaining the visa is not easy, as it involves so many sub-processes to finalise the application form. Each foreign nation has its visa processing timeline, so students should be aware of the same and start their visa application process at the earliest irrespective of the start date of their study program.</p>
